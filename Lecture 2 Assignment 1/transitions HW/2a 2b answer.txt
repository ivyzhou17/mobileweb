2a. If I utilize the term "all", what can I delete from the following code?     
transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear; 

We can delete Background and Color

2b. Define the following timing functions/transitioning elements:
           
"CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration."

ease: transition slowly at beginning and end, speeds up in the middle of transition
linear: same transition speed throughout
ease-in: slow beginning transition
ease-out: slow ending transition
ease-in-out: similar to ease, but slower beginning and end transitions
cubic bezier: transition “runs up” first
